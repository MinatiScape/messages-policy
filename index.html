    <h1>Privacy Policy for Messages by CipherOS</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 14/10/2024</p>

    <p>Welcome to the privacy policy for <strong>Messages by CipherOS</strong> (the "App"), the default messaging app in CipherOS devices. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information, including your phone number, to ensure compliance with Google Play’s policies.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> The App requires access to your phone number to provide essential messaging functionality, such as sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Access to your contacts ensures that messages are associated with the correct contacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To enable sending and receiving SMS/MMS messages.</li>
        <li>To display your phone number during communication with other users.</li>
        <li>To ensure message delivery and manage contact associations within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your personal information, including phone numbers, with any third-party services or advertisers. Your phone number is only used locally on your device for communication purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access. However, since the App relies on system permissions for messaging, data transmitted through SMS/MMS is subject to the security policies of your carrier network.</p>

    <h2>5. Open-Source Transparency</h2>
    <p>The App is fully open-source, and the source code can be reviewed on our official repository: 
        <a href="https://github.com/CipherOS/android_packages_apps_Messaging" target="_blank">Messages by CipherOS GitHub Repository</a>. 
        This ensures transparency in how your data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>The App does not store your phone number beyond what is required for messaging services. All data is retained locally on your device. Deleting a conversation within the app will permanently remove that data.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or regulatory requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we recommend reviewing it periodically.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
